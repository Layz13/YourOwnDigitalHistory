# Paradata: How the Game Came to Be

## Why this topic? 
   Video games has long been a very important topic to me. Since I was young, I have loved playing video games all the time! But I don’t think I realized the true sexism and 
   toxicity that the gaming culture held until a few years back. People would always question me on why I didn’t play certain types of games (like shooting or ones with voice chat)
   and it was because of my fear from the toxicity that is seen throughout the gaming community towards women; This is why this topic is extremely important to me. 
   
## Why this approach? & The reason as to why I chose to make this.
   A video game about the history of video games and the sexism found throughout them, it’s the best way to show a gamer the truth of this community, mainly when it displays 
   nostalgic games and memories. I chose to make it a simple interactive game because I wanted it to symbolize a form of nostalgia, which is why I also enjoyed the pixel format 
   of Bitsy. Bitsy was the perfect tool for me to apply the feeling of nostalgia into the game. I wanted the player to feel like they were young again and they were playing extremely
   pixelated games, I wanted to make sure that feeling of nostalgia was significant to the player. The game that inspired me to go with this approach was a game that I used to be so 
   obsessed with called ‘Ib.’ It was pixelated and filled with an amazing storyline! Of course, I wasn’t able to recreate the beauty of that game, but I hope I was able to at least 
   give off the same nostalgic feeling it gives me. 
   
## What basic steps allowed you to put this thing together?
  After completing the research that was needed, articles and game engines, I found that Bitsy best represented what I wanted to create. So, with that in mind I started 
     lookingat tutorials on how to use bitsy (Here are some really good ones: https://bitsy.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorials) and I started to create some ideas. To help me put my thoughts 
     together I created a Twine game, which helped me create the structure of the storyline and know what rooms I needed to create on Bitsy. From there I just tried and tested 
     till I got to the end result! I think doing trials (that many times failed) made me even more proud of the final game because I can’t believe I truly made a game! 
     
## What evidence/data/material did you use? 
  I have already done a large amount of research on this topic and throughout making it I found some more resources that display the true toxicity and sexism found within the
  gaming community. These articles look into and try to explore the reasons as to how/why games are sexist and what impact they have on the female self identity. 
### Here are some great resources on this topic and many of which I used to construct the storyline:

## How this constructs meaning about the past? 
   This process was not the easiest, mainly for someone who knows near to nothing about coding and tech-y stuff; But with the creation of this game, I am able to create a 
   form of nostalgia that communicates the history of sexism found within games. This game was not only supposed to teach the person playing about the history of games but 
   also kind of transport them to a time in life where they would play pixelated games and were at their family home. When making the game I thought a lot about games I used 
   to play on the Nintendo and how they always gave me a sense of comfort, I wanted to emit that feeling in the game. Through the feeling of nostalgia, I wanted to connect with
   the player and show them although gaming could have been a really fun journey for them, it isn’t like that for everyone because of their gender and identity. Some people don’t 
   get the same experiences because they can’t join a gaming community that doesn’t accept them as characters in a game or even a player. I hope that the game was able to signify 
   that feeling and emotion towards the players. 

## Conclusion 
Overall, I think I truly enjoyed creating this game a lot. It was a difficult process at certain times, but I have never felt so proud of something that I have accomplished, 
mainly since it fits a topic that is very important to me. Through the creation of this game, I was able to live a little bit of nostalgia while also focusing on speaking up 
about a topic that is extremely important to me. 

# Thank you so much for joining me on this journey!
