# Devlog 3: Almost there
 These past two weeks I have worked a bit more on the creation of my game. I have thought out some endings but still haven't chosen which one I will go with. Most importantly, I
 made a lot of progress with the bitsy game. 

## Adding Items
 Items in the game are really helpful! The items are things that the character can pick up, they can have a dialog and they can unlock exits. For example, if you don't want the player to 
 enter another room before finding something, make it into an item and go to the exits & endings tab. Click on the exit you would want lock and click on the button that says 
"+ Add Lock". This will open up a little tab on the side which will show you the code which lets you unlock the door if the item is collected. To change which item needs to be collected,
click on the name of the item on the little tab and a drop box will show you all the items you have created; Pick the one that you want the player to find before unlocking the room. You can
also add dialog in that same tab for when the player finds it locked or unlocks it.

For my game, I chose to use the items a bit differently. I treated them as a form of adding dialog throughout the game. The little animated arrows? They are all items and not sprites and 
there is a reason for this. When you go near an item, it will show you the dialog and then dissapear but with a sprite it will remain there; Also, it will act like a wall so you won't be able
to walk through it, which I found to be annoying. Instead, I made little arrow items that create dialogs when the character steps on them! I found this to be the perfect way for creating the story line
I wanted. To do this it is actually very easy! Firstly, click on the button that says 'item' in the paint tab and click on the + sign on the top. Create the item you want and just place it into the room
of your choice (Unlike sprites, the items can be added multiple times throughout the rooms but remember they will have the same dialog if they are based on the same painted tile). Adding the dialog and 
animation is done exactly the same as with tiles and sprites.

## Creating Sprites 
 As much as I kind of disliked using sprites, they are very helpful when it is a person or animal that you want to add! The reason for this is because they act like a wall and they don't dissapear after
 dialog. To create one, go to the paint tab and click on the button that says 'Sprite' this will open a tile for you to create on. Create the character of your choice and add them to the room of your choice. 
 The sprite can only be used once and if you click on another area, it will dissapear from its previous place. The sprite can also have animation and dialog as well, the same way as before.

## Problems Encountered & Something I Wish I Did Differently
I think this time was the first time I truly got into some trouble while working with bitsy. I'm unsure if the game engine has an undo button because if it does, I sure can't find it! I think something 
that got to me while working on the game was how I would sometimes click on the wrong tile and it would completely remove it and then I would have to go searching through *ALL OF THE TILES* to find
the right one. I don't think I can explain how much this frusturated me because it is not easy at all trying to find the right tile amongst all of the tiles (which many of them look alike). 
There is an option where you can title the tiles (so you can find them easily) but I find it more difficult finding a name for every corner and every few pixels of something.
Looking back at it now, I wish I just put simple titles such as "Couch" just so I can know at least where each tile belonged. 

# Almost done now! Thank you for joining me on this journey!
