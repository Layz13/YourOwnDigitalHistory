# Devlog 1: Interactive Bitsy Game

   The idea that I had for my project is creating a bitsy game based on the History of video games and it's gender socialization from a young age. I'm still in the beginning processes of this game but I already know the steps that I want to take for the future of the game. I want the game to be an interactive story where the player gets to learn about the effect of video games on gender socialization and which ways video games have been able to produce these gender scripts throughout their representation of the femenine and masculine binary. 
   
   
Looking back at the video games I used to play when I was younger, I could easily see how the games I played followed feminine gender scripts and reinforced these ideologies from a young age. Since then, video games have developed and changed a lot but they still largely impact the female self-identity. This is because the majority of video games created today are created by males who grew up with the old vieo games that reinforced gender stereotypes. 

## What I have completed so far

I already have an idea of where I want the game to go and how the story is going to go. Since I already knew how I want it to look and how the story is going to be followed, I have started constructing the different 'rooms' for the game. I have also attached in this repo the html of what I have done so far for this game. Unfortunately, at this moment I haven't completed the entrances and exits yet so if played right now, you will only be able to see the start room. 

These are screenshots of the rooms that I have done for now. I am still going to add more details into each of the rooms but this is going to be the main structure of all the rooms. 

Firstly, this is the outside of the house:

The inside of the house/Living room:

The Upstairs, to go into the rooms (which I don't have completed yet):

The first room (just the structure):

## The Next Steps

The next steps I am planning on taking is finishing up the structure of the last two rooms. Then I would like to add all the exits/entrances throughout the game and add the characters as well. I am also planning on adding the whole storyline onto twine so I can ensure that I have the idea and the interactive choices down before adding them into the game. 

### Thank you!
