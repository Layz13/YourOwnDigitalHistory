# Devlog 2: Interactive Bitsy Game

Throughout the past two weeks I have been focusing on finishing up the storyline as well as adding important gameplay aspects into my game. I think I still have a good amount to go 
and I wouldn't say I am exactly where I want to be by this time of the year but I am hoping that within the next two weeks it will be fully completed. The main part that I still to 
need to work on is finishing up the last two rooms (the girl bedroom and the boy bedroom), adding the characters, and adding the storyline into the game. 
## Storyline: Twine
The first thing I worked on was creating a Twine game that will follow how the gameplay will look like. By creating the storyline on Twine I am able to know how the game is going 
go and where the entrances and exits within the rooms should be. I finished about 90% of the storyline but I am still thinking about how I am going to end it. I think because I 
want to send a specific message with my game, I want the ending to be strong which is why it is taking me a bit longer to think of.

This is a screenshot of the twine game I created for the storyline of the game. I have also added it to this repo, as a way to see which path I am taking with this game. 

# Bitsy Game Steps
On Bitsy I have been largely focusing on fixing up the rooms that I haven't finished, adding entrances and exits, adding walls, as well as adding interactive characters. 

## Creating Rooms
I think Bitsy is very easy to follow for the mahority of the time. To create a new room the first thing you do is you go to the small tab titled Room and you click the '+' at the 
top right of the tab, it will then create a new room. You can click on the button 'visibility' which will open up options at the bottom of the room tab. Those options are grid (remove or add 
the grid), walls (see or hide the tiles that use walls), and Exits and endings (see or hide the exits and endings in the rooms).

You will then be taken to an empty room (as shown in the picture above) and from there you can start creating the room that you would like to create. On the tab next to the room tab
there is a tab called 'paint' and this tab includes all of the tiles, characters, and items found throughout the game. To create the area of the room the focus will be on the tiles.
To create a tile click on the '+' found on the top right of the tab. Then you will be shown an empty tile. When you click on one of the blocks within the tiles it changes the color of it.
Throughout thi game, you focus on two different colors and create shapes through it. For every tile, it fits into one of the blocks found in the room.

Keep creating tiles and adding them throughout the room to be able to create the room that you want to achieve! You can also use a tile more than once throughout the room. But remember, 
if you if want to make change on one tile and not the rest (if they are using the same tile), you have to create a new tile or they will all change. This can be done easily with the use
of the create copy feature found on top of the paint tab, which looks like two pages on top of each other. This creates an exact copy of the tile but you can make small changes to it and 
add it to the block that needs the change.

You can also add little animations to the tiles! You can do this by clicking on 'Animation' at the bottom left of the tile tab. This will open a frame 1 and a Frame 2 at the bottom of the 
tile tab. Click on Frame 2 and color in/remove color of the areas you would like to change. The left side of frame one, it will show you a preview of how it will look!

## Walls! 
Something that I worked on a lot throughout these past two weeks is adding walls onto my tiles throughout the different rooms. What are walls? They are when the tile added becomes a wall
that the character can't walk on, through, or across. For example, This way it ensures that if the character wants to walk into the house, they don't walk on top of the house, since they 
are blocked from doing so. This can be done by going to the paint tab, clicking on the tile you would like to act as a wall, and clicking the button 'wall' at the bottom left of the tab. 
This is how it will looks with the visibility of walls on and off. The black blocks is where the character is unable to cross. Ta-da! You have walls!!

## Exits and Endings!
Now you have the rooms created, how are you going to move through them? Exits & Endings!! This was something that took me a bit to work with properly but once you get the hang of it, it's actually 
really easy! At the bottom of the room tab, there is a button called 'exits & endings' which is right next to colors. Once you click that, it will open a new tab called 'exits & endings'. 
Once you have that, click on the '+' button and it will ask if you want to create an 'exit', 'one-way exit', or an 'ending'. If you click exit you create an exit that the character can move back
and forth through freely. If you choose one-way exit, the character can only go through it once and won't be able to leave through the same exit. If you choose ending, it creates an exit for an ending. 
They all follow the same functions when using them, so let's look at the one-way exit feature. Once you click it, it will show you the exit and the destination. A tile with a one way arrow will show up in 
room, and you can move it to where you would like the exit to be. Then to pick a destination, go to the room you want the exit to take the player and click the 'move' button under the destination picture.
Then click the block you would like to have the player enter from. Make sure that you click the move button after going to the room you want the destination to be, or it won't work.

There is also a choice where you can make different types of transitions by using the exits, which is found above the narration options. You can also add exit dialog (which shows up when the player uses the exit). You can do this by clicking the button 'add narration' at the bottom of the the exits tab. Additionally, you can add a lock to the exit by clicking the button 
'add lock' which is next to the narration button. Using this feature, the player won't be able to use the exit until they find a specific item (that can be created through the paint tab). It will open a new tab that will display the condition
the player needs to meet to be able to open the door and the dialog that can be used for the locked or unlocked exit.

# What I have left to complete
My next focus for the game is to finish up the room designs, which I am fixing up a bit due to size issues that didn't make sense to me. For example, some rooms that made had extremely large doors when compared to the characters. Then I will be adding the rest
of the dialog and the support characters throughout the game. Hopefully I will be able to complete all the goals I have for the game! Also, I am hoping that I will come up wih the perfect ending to the game, that will help me perfect the idea I have for this game overall. 

## Thank you!
